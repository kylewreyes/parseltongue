One reason for this is that diverting water for irrigation can con-

impossible.

the widespread use of water pumps, barrages were used for this. Iraqi
farmers constructed them of reeds, brushwood, and earth (for details

Thisfloodwatchconsistedofworkgangswithanaveragesizeof15

and other locations for about two weeks. At times, as was the case in
KingŠu-Suen’s(SS)sixthandseventhyearofreign,thefloodwatchwas
in place for one or two months with a fairly large number of people
(e.g., 49 in SS06). Different work crews were placedsimultaneously at
various high-risk points, while others alternated in patrolling the river
levee to cover a period of 1–2months (see Rost, 2015, Appendix D.,
Table D.1).
These work gangs would also be the ones who would intervene
when the river was threating to overtop its banks. As can be seen in
Table 7, the flood must have been particularly severe in the third and
fourth regnal years of King Šu-Suen reign, calling for the partial or
entire demolition (ku ) of some of the major Tigris barrages at Apisal

d
and Eduru- Šulpa’e and the Sisa-canal. These two years are the only
timethatanintervention,whichentailedthedemolitionofmajorTigris
barrages was necessary to cope with major flood events. There are no
other records within the Umma corpus that document the dismantling
(ku ) of barrages on that scale. The records in question are sealed by

and Lugal-nesag (see Table 7) and allowed for reconstructing the

gub-ba) for a period up to two months. As the river threatened to
overtop its levee, the same group of workers and their supervisors
dismantled the big Tigris barragesin orderto remove the blockages in
the river. It is clear, that the combination of monitoring the river’s
water levels and the occasional demolition was a vital measure to
counterbalance the strategicplacement of barragesand waskey to the
smooth functioning of the system that was designed to accommodate
the demands for irrigation as well as navigation with that of flood
control.
9. Thewater management scheme in its wider political context
Managing the river as comprehensively as can be gleaned from the
ancient texts required not only the technical and hydraulic knowhow,
but also a huge investment in man-hours and construction materials.
Furthermore,thelogisticsinvolvedintherecruitmentandmanagement

sophisticatedsystemofcoordination.Suchcoordinationwasrealizedin
the Ur III Period with a highly sophisticated system of accounting.
Moreover, as any manipulation of the river will affect both – it’s up-
stream and downstream behavior, there is a need for a coordinated
approach on a regional level to assure the smooth functioning of the
water management scheme. The question one might ask is why the
provincial government of Umma went to such great length to control

The economy of the Ur III state rested upon a region-wide taxation
system, called bala in Sumerian, which means “rotation” or “transfer”
in the broadest sense (Sharlach, 2004). This system had elements of a
