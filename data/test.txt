(Smith et al., 2016; Wassenburg et al., 2016), even if investi-
18
gations of O composition of precipitation do not always
reproduce a ?delity with NAO pressure patterns (Field, 2010;
Baldini et al., 2008). Dominguez-Villar et al. (2017) suggest
that most of the isotopic signal in Iberian speleothems is not
principally related to the amount of precipitation but rather
to changes in the ratio of recycled precipitation, and is corre-
lated to pressure patterns over the North Atlantic. Therefore,
18
some authors suggest that the  O of the speleothem cal-
cite is a direct expression of the North Atlantic in?uence and
state, especially in the western Mediterranean (e.g., Smith
et al., 2016; Wassenburg et al., 2016) during winter months.
However, a change in provenance of precipitation (Holmes et
al., 2010) and precipitation amount during winter and sum-
mer months can further complicate the interpretation of the
18
 O records. Therefore, a unifying and completely satis-
18
factory explanation for  O of calcite is probably not yet
available throughout the Mediterranean area and surround-
ing regions (Moreno et al., 2014). It is important also to re-
18
member that the  O signal is skewed towards the period
of calcite precipitation and its relation with cave recharge.
As anticipated, the authors tend to assume that most of the
cave recharge occurs during winter (or autumn–winter) and
18
most of the O signal should be related to this condition
(Deininger et al., 2017). In some instances, the complex in-
18
terpretation of  O as a direct climatic proxy has led dif-
13
ferent authors to prefer C of speleothem calcite as a bet-
ter hydrological indicator of local conditions (e.g., Genty et
al., 2006; Göktürk et al., 2011). The number of factors in-
13
?uencing the ?nal  C value of a speleothem (e.g., Müh-
linghaus et al., 2009) make this proxy probably just as, if not
18
more, complicated as  O, and in addition, for the strong
13 12
in?uence of soil-CO production on the ?nal C= C ratio
2
on speleothems, a change in land use and deforestation can
have a particularly prominent effect, making it particularly
sensitive to human impact above and within the cave. It is
usually reported that speleothems possess a superior chronol-
ogy compared to other archives thanks to the U–Th technique
(e.g., Richards and Dorale, 2003). However, this assumption
is strictly true for speleothems acting as a closed system for
the uranium (Bajo et al., 2016) and with only minor clastic
contamination (Hellstrom, 2006). For this review, we have
selected 16 records (Fig. 2; Table 1). The main reason for ex-
cluding some records is the presence of long hiatuses (thou-
sands of years) over the 4.2 ka BP Event that may not nec-
essarily relate to climatic conditions, e.g., Villars, Chauvet,
and La Mine caves (Genty et al., 2006) and Carburangeli
Cave (Frisia et al., 2006). Some records have been rejected
for their U–Th chronologies, as shown in later studies (e.g.,
Savi Cave; Frisia et al., 2005), with ages disputed in Belli et
al. (2013). However, shorter hiatuses coherent with isotopic

creased aridity since this time. However, this is a general sig-
nal and not speci?cally related to a short interval, suggesting
that eventual increasing in aridity during the 4.2 ka BP Event
is within a general frame of increasing aridi?cation.
2.1.2 Lacustrine settings
The oxygen isotope composition of lacustrine carbonates in
the Mediterranean region is usually interpreted as mainly be-
ing controlled by changes in the isotopic composition of lake
water (Roberts et al., 2008), which is controlled by differ-

precipitation and the degree of evaporation (Zanchetta et al.,
2007b; Leng et al., 2010a). Each lacustrine setting has a dif-
18
ferent set of responses and different water O enrichment
(Roberts et al., 2008; Leng et al., 2010a, b) due to evapora-
tive effects, which depend on several factors, namely tem-
perature, relative humidity, wind fetch and strength, and res-
idence time of body water (e.g., Craig et al., 1965). Different
types of carbonates (e.g., ostracods, freshwater shells, bio-
induced carbonates) may precipitate during different parts of
the year, with bio-induced calcite (endogenic) often related
to spring–summer algal bloom (Leng and Marshall, 2004).
18
Therefore, the O of endogenic carbonate will tend to be
weighted towards the summer conditions, although care is
necessary for their interpretation and more complex options
have been proposed (e.g., Zielhofer et al., 2018). Endogenic
carbonates can be contaminated by clastic carbonates (Leng

most of the selected records have been performed using the
modern analogue technique (MAT) (Guiot, 1990), an “as-
semblage approach” frequently used in climate reconstruc-
tions. This method was successfully used for the Holocene
climate reconstructions from terrestrial and marine records
(e.g., Peyron et al., 2011, 2017; Mauri et al., 2014, 2015).
MAT is based on a comparison of past assemblages to mod-
ern pollen assemblages. An important requirement is the
need for a high-quality training set of modern samples. The
training set should be representative of the likely range of
variables, of highest possible taxonomic detail, of compa-
rable quality and from the same sedimentary environment
(Brewer et al., 2013). It must cover a wide environmental
range. Limitations of using MAT are the occurrence of no
analogues or multiple analogues (Birks et al., 2010), and the
potential problem of the spatial autocorrelation with MAT
but also in the transfer functions (Telford and Birks, 2005).
All these interpretations hold if minor human impact is con-
sidered in vegetation and pollen production, which may be
a major concern for some reconstructions (Fyfe et al., 2015,
2018). Figure 5 shows the reconstructed temperatures (an-
nual) and precipitation (annual, winter, and summer) through
the 4.2 ka BP Event.

(Railsback et al., 2018) and in this issue (Kaniewski et al.,
2018). However, there is no clear and coherent evidence of
this in many of the different selected records. A good exam-
ple of the complexity of the evidence and the link to chrono-
logical accuracy is the lake-level record at Lago dell’Accesa.
This was used as the archetypal example to demonstrate
that, in reality, the event is “tripartite” (Magny et al., 2009),
where a phase characterized by drier conditions at approxi-
mately 4100–3950 cal BP appeared bracketed by two phases
marked by wetter conditions and dated to approximately
4300–4100 and 3950–3850 cal BP, respectively (Magny et
al., 2009). Magny et al. (2009) reported a signi?cant number
of records over the Mediterranean showing reasonably the
same climatic evidence. However, subsequent works using
tephra layers (Avellino and other tephras are present in Lago
dell’Accesa; Magny et al., 2007) showed the inconsistency
of this detailed correlation, and the 4.2 ka BP Event should
be dominated by lower lake level (Zanchetta et al., 2012a, b,
2016), supporting the existence of a prominent drier phase.
To circumvent some of the complex issues related to chrono-
logical problems, the authors have used two different ap-
proaches. The ?rst, and the most common, is an accurate
selection of records which show conspicuous and chronolog-
ically consistent evidence of the event (e.g., Drysdale et al.,
2006; Magny et al., 2009; Kaniewski et al., 2018). Records in
which the expression of the event is equivocal are usually re-
moved. A different approach is more “climatostratigraphic”,
which is used instead of a simple chronological selection of
a time window to correlate the event on the basis of similar-
ity of the climatic curve. This has the obvious limitation that
any regional articulation and/or timing progression will be
lost. For instance, we can force the correlation of Skala Mar-
18
ion O record with those of the Renella, Mavri Trypa, and
Solufar caves (Fig. 7; for instance, Psomiadis et al., 2018, im-
plicitly followed this approach in their Fig. 6, for Skala Mar-
ion, Renella, and Solufar cave records), to assume that the
interval at approximately 3.9–3.4 ka characterized by higher
18
 O values at Skala Marion corresponds to a similar interval
at approximately 4.3–3.8 ka that is well identi?ed in Renella
and Mavri Trypa. Therefore, we are aware that the chrono-
logical issue can heavily contaminate the following discus-
sion. In the following sections, we separate proxies on the
basis of their presumed meaning: annual average vs. seasonal
component. Maps are produced (Fig. 8) specifying the lo-
cal record condition (i.e., warmer/cooler and/or drier/wetter).
For reasons that may depend on chronology, proxy sensitiv-
ity, and/or local response to climatic change, it is not always

ditions compared to the other analyzed sectors, where they
show wetter or at least more variable conditions. Winter pre-
cipitation reconstructed from pollen shows clear indications
of decreased precipitation at Ledro, Lake Pergusa, MD90-
917, and MD95-2043 (even if modest). Drier conditions are
evident for most of the interval at Lago Trifoglietti (with a
late recovery toward wetter conditions), whereas in Malta
most of the interval shows wetter conditions compared to the
previous period. Lago dell’Accesa shows a strong oscillatory
behavior, with the central part of the drier interval bracketed
by two wetter intervals. However, the general trend of Lago
dell’Accesa cannot be classi?ed unambiguously as wetter or
drier. Figure 8c shows the prevailing precipitation conditions
(wetter/drier for the interval considered) during winter for the
proxy in question. Geographically, it seems quite consistent
that most of the Mediterranean records show drier conditions
during winter. Despite the poor coverage, the possible excep-
tions are Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula, as well as some
sectors of the eastern Mediterranean, possibly indicating a
regional articulation.
3.4 Summer conditions
As discussed in Sect. 2.1.2, endogenic lacustrine carbonates
can be considered reasonably as a ?rst-order hydrological
(precipitation minus evaporation) signal of summer, even if
in?uenced by the effect of recharge during previous periods.
Some records (Sidi Ali, Ohrid, Hula) show no peculiar trends
during the period considered, although for a very short inter-
val centered at approximately 4.2 ka, Zielhofer et al. (2018)

mody et al. (2012), the dominant pattern of variability in hu-
midity between 3.3 and 1.0 ka shows a seesaw pattern with
Spain and Israel on one side and the central Mediterranean on
the other. The patterns in climatic humidity are similar to pre-
cipitation anomalies associated with the east Atlantic/west
Russia pattern, which today represents a secondary mode of
precipitation pattern during winter within the dominance of
the NAO pattern (Xoplaki et al., 2004). It is clear that the cen-
ter of action of the seesaw pattern may have changed in time
with con?guration not precisely similar to today. It is inter-
esting to note that Persoiu¸ et al. (2018) suggested that part of
the drier and cold conditions over the Mediterranean during
the 4.2 ka BP Event was caused by the strengthening and ex-
pansion of the Siberian High, which effectively blocked the
moisture-carrying westerlies and enhanced outbreaks of cold
