to changes in the ratio of recycled precipitation, and is corre-
lated to pressure patterns over the North Atlantic. Therefore,

state, especially in the western Mediterranean (e.g., Smith
et al., 2016; Wassenburg et al., 2016) during winter months.
However, a change in provenance of precipitation (Holmes
al., 2010) and precipitation amount during winter and sum-
mer months can further complicate the interpretation of
18
 O records. Therefore, a unifying and completely satis-
18
factory explanation for  O of calcite is probably not
available throughout the Mediterranean area and surround-
ing regions (Moreno et al., 2014). It is important also to

As anticipated, the authors tend to assume that most of

for their U‚ÄìTh chronologies, as shown in later studies (e.g.,

2.1.2 Lacustrine settings
oxygen isotope composition of lacustrine carbonates in
Mediterranean region is usually interpreted as mainly be-
controlled by changes in the isotopic composition of lake
ater (Roberts et al., 2008), which is controlled by differ-
factors, including changes in the isotopic composition of
precipitation and the degree of evaporation (Zanchetta et al.,
2007b; Leng et al., 2010a). Each lacustrine setting has a dif-
18
ferent set of responses and different water O enrichment
Roberts et al., 2008; Leng et al., 2010a, b) due to evapora-
effects, which depend on several factors, namely tem-
perature, relative humidity, wind fetch and strength, and res-
idence time of body water (e.g., Craig et al., 1965). Different
types of carbonates (e.g., ostracods, freshwater shells, bio-
induced carbonates) may precipitate during different parts of
year, with bio-induced calcite (endogenic) often related
spring‚Äìsummer algal bloom (Leng and Marshall, 2004).
18
Therefore, the O of endogenic carbonate will tend to be
weighted towards the summer conditions, although care is
necessary for their interpretation and more complex options
e been proposed (e.g., Zielhofer et al., 2018). Endogenic
carbonates can be contaminated by clastic carbonates (Leng

(Railsback et al., 2018) and in this issue (Kaniewski et
2018). However, there is no clear and coherent evidence
this in many of the different selected records. A good exam-
ple of the complexity of the evidence and the link to chrono-
logical accuracy is the lake-level record at Lago dell‚ÄôAccesa.
This was used as the archetypal example to demonstrate
that, in reality, the event is ‚Äútripartite‚Äù (Magny et al., 2009
where a phase characterized by drier conditions at approxi-
mately 4100‚Äì3950 cal BP appeared bracketed by two phases
marked by wetter conditions and dated to approximately
4300‚Äì4100 and 3950‚Äì3850 cal BP, respectively (Magny
al., 2009). Magny et al. (2009) reported a signiÔ¨Åcant number
of records over the Mediterranean showing reasonably
same climatic evidence. However, subsequent works using
tephra layers (Avellino and other tephras are present in Lago
dell‚ÄôAccesa; Magny et al., 2007) showed the inconsistenc
of this detailed correlation, and the 4.2 ka BP Event should
be dominated by lower lake level (Zanchetta et al., 2012a
2016), supporting the existence of a prominent drier phase.
To circumvent some of the complex issues related to chrono-
logical problems, the authors have used two different
proaches. The Ô¨Årst, and the most common, is an accurate
selection of records which show conspicuous and chronolog-
ically consistent evidence of the event (e.g., Drysdale et
2006; Magny et al., 2009; Kaniewski et al., 2018). Records
which the expression of the event is equivocal are usually
moved. A different approach is more ‚Äúclimatostratigraphic‚Äù,
which is used instead of a simple chronological selection
a time window to correlate the event on the basis of similar
ity of the climatic curve. This has the obvious limitation
any regional articulation and/or timing progression will

18
 O values at Skala Marion corresponds to a similar interv
at approximately 4.3‚Äì3.8 ka that is well identiÔ¨Åed in Renella
and Mavri Trypa. Therefore, we are aware that the chrono-
logical issue can heavily contaminate the following discus-
sion. In the following sections, we separate proxies on
basis of their presumed meaning: annual average vs. seasonal
component. Maps are produced (Fig. 8) specifying the
cal record condition (i.e., warmer/cooler and/or drier/wetter).

sectors of the eastern Mediterranean, possibly indicating

As discussed in Sect. 2.1.2, endogenic lacustrine carbonates
can be considered reasonably as a Ô¨Årst-order hydrological
(precipitation minus evaporation) signal of summer, even
inÔ¨Çuenced by the effect of recharge during previous periods.
Some records (Sidi Ali, Ohrid, Hula) show no peculiar trends
during the period considered, although for a very short inter
